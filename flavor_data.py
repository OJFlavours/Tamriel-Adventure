            "Welcome to the Nightgate. Hadring's the name. This old inn has seen its share of blizzards and weary travelers. We don't get the crowds of the city taverns, and that's just fine by me. Keeps the riff-raff out.",
            "Nightgate Inn. It's a lonely place, but it's sturdy. Stands against the worst the Pale can throw at it. If you're looking for a place to rest where the wind's the loudest voice, you've found it.",
